## 📍 Overview

The repository contains a template for a front-end web developer portfolio website. It includes sections for an "About Me" introduction, a "Work" portfolio showcasing projects, and a "Contact Me" section with links to email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and CodersRank. The code references external CSS and image files for styling and multimedia content. It provides consistent font sizes and colors, global CSS resets, and responsive layouts for different screen sizes.

## 📦 Features

|    | Feature            | Description                                                                                                        |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**   | The repository contains a simple front-end web developer's portfolio website. It follows a traditional monolithic architectural design, with all the HTML and CSS code contained in single files. The website is organized into sections for "About Me," "Work," and "Contact Me," allowing easy navigation for visitors.|
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | The codebase has no external dependencies, meaning it does not rely on any external libraries or systems. All functionality and styling are implemented using HTML and CSS code, making it self-contained and easily deployable.|
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | The codebase lacks modularity as it is composed of only two files: index.html and style.css. However, the code does demonstrate a separation of concerns, with the HTML file handling the structure and content, while the CSS file manages the styling and layout.|
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | The codebase does not have any explicit testing strategies or tools. As a static front-end website, it does not require extensive automated testing. However, manual testing should be performed to ensure proper rendering and functionality across different browsers and devices.|
| ⚡️  | **Performance**    | The performance of the website is dependent on the user's device and network connection. The codebase is lightweight, and the absence of complex functionalities ensures fast loading times. The CSS file utilizes media queries to provide a responsive layout for screens smaller than 1200px, enhancing the user experience on different devices.|
| 🔐 | **Security**       | The repository does not implement any specific security measures. However, since it is a simple front-end portfolio website, security risks are minimal. No user inputs or sensitive data handling is involved.|
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| The repository uses Git for version control. |
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | The codebase does not have any explicit integrations with other systems or services. However, it includes links to external platforms such as email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and CodersRank. These links enable users to interact with the portfolio owner through different platforms. Additional integrations, such as embedding social media feeds or third-party APIs, could enhance the functionality of the portfolio.|
| 📶 | **Scalability** | The website's scalability is limited as it does not include any backend functionality or dynamic content generation. However, the codebase can be easily expanded by adding new sections, projects, or updating the existing content as the developer's portfolio evolves. |

The sections contain heading and paragraph elements, images, and links to projects and external sites (such as email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and CodersRank). Overall, the code creates a visually appealing and informative portfolio website. |
